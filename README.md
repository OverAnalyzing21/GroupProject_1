This is a collaborative project between Riley, Anthony, and Myself

[--- THE SILVER SCREEN FILM MACHINE---]


Do you ever find yourself just scrolling through the movies on Netflix or another streaming application for minutes on end, not sure what to choose in the vast sea of options?

Are you the type of person who loves going to the movie theater, but just can't decide which movies are work seeing?

Well, if you answered yes to either of these questions, then the SILVER SCREEN FILM MACHINE might just be the website to help you out!

(And even if you didn't ask either of those questions, just check it out anyway!)

In this project, we wanted to find a way to assist people in figuring out what genre of movies might pique their interest in the form of a "personality quiz". Throughout the quiz, a participant will have to answer a small handful of serious and humorous questions in order to find their ideal genre of film. APIs from YouTube and IMDB are provided at the end as well so participants can view trailers and reviews of movies they might have an interest in without even having to leave the page!
